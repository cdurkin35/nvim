# Custom NeoVim Configuration

Neovim configuration based on NvChad 2.5.

## Languages with LSP support

    - Lua
    - C
    - C++
    - Python
    - Rust

## Languages with linter support

    - Lua
    - Markdown
    - Python

> **Note**
> C and C++ diagnostics come from the `clangd` language server. Running an
> additional external linter alongside `clangd` tends to surface the same
> warnings twice, so only the LSP diagnostics are shown for those filetypes.


## Languages with debugging support

    - C
    - C++
    - Python
